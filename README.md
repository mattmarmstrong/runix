A hobby OS, brought to you by the Rust Foundation ©️

I started this following:

I also heavily plagarized code from the x86_64 crate in some sections: 

https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/

I have no idea how far I'll actually get with this, but I've really enjoyed using this as an opportunity to learn about operating systems.
